## Module 4 HW - DBT Fundamentals on Ticket Data - Jack McCullers

### Introduction:

The purpose of this assignment was to use DBT as a way to set up models, marts, and tests for the module 2 homework tickit data. After completing the dbt fundamentals course I began work on the assignment. I needed to upload my files into BigQuery as csv files. After creating my project, I created datasets, and individual tables underneath. These tables are the same ones as my 7 csv files for the tables of ticket data. I then connected my dbt and BigQuery storage through the use of APIs. The final connection was to an empty github repository. I needed to redo my dbt account since the free trial period had ended. 

### Assignment Work Documentation

When completing the assignment I followed some of the tests identified in the additional courses to satisfy the requirement. For my generic tests I was establishing and identifying unique, not-null, and relationship between tables for my table keys. These can be viewed within my YAML files. I was unsure if this documentaiton should be in there since the dbt training said it already creates documentation. I worked with my tutor to make sure that I was completing the proper tests. The establishment of the staging models were to query into my tables from BigQuery. From there my data tables become visible using similar code to my module 2 homework. I tried to provide further descriptions on the data after reviewing the homework submission requirements for documentation.
